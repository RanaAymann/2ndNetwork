! spanning-tree protocol
! backup path to prevent broadcasts storms.
! I need redundant or fault-tolerant network.

Root bridge ( center of the network )
! everything go through him
! 1- the oldest switch , 2- Bridge priority[ 0 - 65535 ]  , 3- bridge MAC
! BRIDGE ID = Bridge priority + bridge MAC
! the lower bridge ID = ROOT bridge 
! STP default priority =32768 or 0x8000

! 32768.MAC (the switch's MAC)
! 802.1d the common one. [ 30-50] outage.

! RSTP (802.1w) , also single common STP
 
! MSTP(VLANS) 802.1s or MTP enables RSTP 
! types : PVST+ [802.1D] this is a per-VLAN implementation of 802.1d 
! also PVRST.

! Root port : lowest-COST path. (BW)
! blocked port : stops the loops

! RSTP : to speed up convergence ( relies on timers )
! portfast : edge ports non-STP-capable devices and non-trunking ports.
switch(config-if)#spanning-tree portfast
or 
switch(config)#spanning-tree portfast default

! PVST 
! allows to make root switch different in each VLAN 
#spanning-tree mode pvst
#spanning-tree mode rapid-pvst

#spanning-tree vlan <> priority <>
! change the priority for each VLAN to change the root to each VLAN.
! increment(x2) = 4096
! The 12-bit VLAN-ID called : system ID extension

#spanning-tree vlan 1 priority 4096
#spanning-tree vlan 1 priority 8192
 or 
#spanning-tree vlan 1 root primary
#spanning-tree vlan 1 root secondary

#spanning-tree vlan 1 cost <>
