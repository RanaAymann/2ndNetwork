! spanning-tree protocol
! backup path to prevent broadcasts storms.
! I need redundant or fault-tolerant network.

Root bridge ( center of the network )
! everything go through him
! 1- the oldest switch , 2- Bridge priority[ increment(x2) = 4096]  , 3- bridge MAC
! BRIDGE ID = Bridge priority + bridge MAC
! the lower bridge ID = ROOT bridge 

! 32768.MAC (the switch's MAC)
! 802.1d the common one. [ 30-50] outage.

! RSTP (802.1w) , also single common STP
 
! MSTP(VLANS) 802.1s or MTP enables RSTP 
! types : PVST+ [802.1D] this is a per-VLAN implementation of 802.1d 
! also PVRST.

! Root port : lowest-COST path. (BW)
! blocked port : stops the loops
